Hi there ðŸ‘‹! Iâ€™m Hezron, known online as Qahnaxy, I am full-stack developer by day ðŸŒ„ and a web security enthusiast by night ðŸŒ’. I build high-performance, secure, and scalable web systems with precision and intent. My code isnâ€™t written to just work, itâ€™s written to endure, scale, and perform under pressure. I treat architecture like strategy and optimization like art.
Currently open to contract-based collaborations and select long-term projects that demand technical depth, clean architecture, and measurable impact. And hey, if you want to become friends, a Hi! is a dm away.
